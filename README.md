Created by Brandon Akitch with a little guidance from Moringa School. 
The website gives detailed information about who I am and invites other people to join me in working on other projects on github. It entails links to some of the projects I have worked on. 
The set-up is quite simple;just click on the webpage link https://brandy-code.github.io/portfolio-landing-project/ and ensure you have network connection.The link will open you browser after which the webpage will be unveiled. 
At the moment the program has no known bugs. 
The program was created using HTML and CSS.The background image was obtained from pexel photos which is a website containing exqusite photos taken by professional photographers.
